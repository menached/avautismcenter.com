    How we engage is as important to our mission as the lessons themselves. We recognize that each individual may have different learning abilities, they may assimilate at a different pace  and  have many different limitations. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="leftalign">
    Anxiety and its  negative effects seem to always be present in most non-verbal or minimally verbal people. These effects seem amplified when they cannot articulate feelings desires opinions or even the simplest of communications.  
    </p>

    <p class="leftalign">
    This is often the result of  their inability to conjure the words that express those wishes desires ideas thoughts and hopes.  These individuals can become more frustrated by the need to articulate justifications for things they feel are right, leading to even more anxiety. They are 100% reliant on those who are charged with their care and their ability to decipher what the non verbal individuals are trying so desperately to convey.   
    </p>

    <p class="leftalign">
    Sometimes they must resort to extreme behaviors in hopes of getting enough attention to try to make it known that they are not being understood.  This can lead to further anxiety as well as negative consequences like misunderstanding  punishment or rejection.

    This is the reason our staff will be required to become Autism Certified and have ongoing education. Signs are almost invisible to the untrained ears and eyes but when coaches, teachers counselors and all other staff are well versed in the signs it becomes much easier to notice the otherwise hidden signals.

    <p class="leftalign">
    While we believe that non verbal adults require specialized help we similarly espouse  that all people with disability are equally deserving of support and this is why we foster a community that welcomes everyone.

    <strong>The Leg Up Program:</strong> 
    </a> Empowers Adults with other Disabilities to help Mentor Non-Verbal Adults in pursuit of Expressive Language Development
    </p>

    <p class="leftalign">
    In a world that often underestimates individuals with disabilities, the "Leg Up Program" is a unique and highly supportive mentoring plan administered under the watchful eye of trained caregivers. 
    </p>

    <p class="leftalign">
    It is designed to  foster a profound sense of mutual empowerment. This pilot program pairs adults with disabilities—those whose impairments are not related to language development—with non-verbal adults who are seeking to enhance their expressive language skills.   
    </p>
    
    <p class="leftalign">
    The supervised  pairs engage in a fun shared experience together and then use that experience to associate vocabulary words and ideas about it., giving them the opportunity to communicate  about something they share in common. 
    </p>

    <p class="leftalign">
    The essence of the Leg Up mentorship incorporates contextual learning, where both participants gain valuable life experience. The mentor gains strength, dignity, and purpose through their collaboration while the mentee becomes immersed in a culture of communication revolving around fun and camaraderie.
